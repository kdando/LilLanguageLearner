## Installation and Set-Up

To run the app locally, first clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/kdando/LilLanguageLearner
```

This project uses Flask and Bootstrap. You can install them individually or run the following to install all dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The project follows the application factory pattern: for live deployment there is an app.py file, however to run locally you can instead run:

```
python3 __main__.py
```
    

## Roadmap

- Incoporate APIs for wider range of languages

- Add user accounts to track progress and allow prioritising different words based on past performance.
